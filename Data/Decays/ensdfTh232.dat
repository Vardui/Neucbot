228RA cN NR        I|g data are per 100 |a decays
228RA c  1989Sa01: Spectra were collected from around 250 |mg/cm{+2}, Th source
228RA2c  for around 80 hours. Anion-exchange separation method was used to
228RA3c  purify Thorium isotopes ({+228,232}Th) in order to minimize the
228RA4c  background due to decay of the daughters. The solution was periodically
228RA5c  purified to minimize the background from the decay of {+228}Th. |g-
228RA6c  spectrum was recorded using HPGe and planar Ge detectors, |a-spectrum
228RA7c  was recorded with Si surface barrier detector.
228RA c  1983Mi30: Measured E{-|g}, I{-|g}, deduced |a-branching ratio and
228RA2c  levels

228RA cL E         From E|g
228RA cA E         From 1989Sa01, unless otherwise noted
228RA cA IA        From I(|g+ce) imbalance at each level based on absolute I|g
228RA2cA data. A 3% uncertainty in the theoretical |a values has been adopted
228RA3cA by the evaluator for the calculation of I(|g+ce).
